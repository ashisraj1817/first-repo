<h2>What is Demonetization?</h2>
<p>
Demonetization is an economic process in which a country’s currency unit is no longer legal tender. A currency unit is what we would commonly refer to as physical money, such as banknotes and coins. When demonetization occurs, the country’s currency unit is essentially worthless, as it can no longer be used to purchase goods and services.
</p>
<p>Demonetization can occur for several reasons, from a change in national currency to the retirement of older forms of money. Over time, several countries have implemented currency demonetization measures, albeit with varying degrees of success.</p>

The Demonetization Process:
</h2>
<p>
Demonetization is a form of economic intervention, where a country moves to replace one form of currency with another. At the beginning of the demonetization process, the old currency is discontinued and pulled from circulation to be replaced with new forms of money.

During the process, people are given time to exchange their existing banknotes and coins for the new currency before it is officially discontinued. After a currency has been discontinued, it is no longer legal tender and contains no monetary value.

The demonetization process can occur in many different forms – a country can introduce new banknotes or coins or implement a completely new form of currency altogether. However, demonetization is a drastic measure that occurs rarely and can disrupt society if implemented improperly. At times, countries may also decide to reinstate discontinued currency as legal tender through a process known as remonetization.
